  <li> Correlation of your account in our LMS via your email address, <b>{username}</b></li>
  <li> Final preparation of your badge
</ul>


<p>Assuming there are no issues with our last few steps, you will receive your <b>Databricks Developer Essentials Badge</b> within 2 weeks. Notification will be made by email to <b>{username}</b> regarding the availability of your digital badge via <b>Accredible</b>. 
Should we have any issues, such as not finding your email address in our LMS, we will do our best to resolve the issue using the email address provided here.
</p>

<p>Your digital badge will be available in a secure, verifiable, and digital format that you can easily retrieve via <b>Accredible</b>. You can then share your achievement via any number of different social media platforms.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the status of your badge after the initial two-week window, or if the email address listed above is incorrect, please <a href="https://help.databricks.com/s/contact-us?ReqType=training" target="_blank">submit a ticket</a> with the subject "Core Capstone" and your Registration ID (<b>{registration_id}</b>) in the message body.

<h2>Almost There!</h2>

<p>Our preliminary evaluation of your project indicates that you have not passed.</p>

<p>In order for your project to be submitted <b>all</b> reality checks in all exercises must pass.</p>

<p>In some cases this problem can be resolved by simply clearning a notebook's state (<b>Clear State & Results</b>) and then selecting <b>Run All</b> from the toolbar above.</p>

<p>If your project continues to fail validation, please review each step in the coresponding exercise to ensure that you are have properly addressed each requirement.</p>
